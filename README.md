# shapefile-condenser
take in shapefiles; return shapefile

# how to run
you'll need pip to install packages. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages in order to run the code.

or try `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` if that doesn't work.

# how it works
currently, the code is all in dbf_editor.py. run it using the command `python dbf_editor.py`

it pulls configs and shapefiles from the shapefile directory, and then prints out some info on the shapes it finds in them.

look at sample_output.txt to see what one of these runs looks like.
